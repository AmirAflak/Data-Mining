# Data Mining Project
This project develops a machine learning model to classify customers based on their features and predict whether they will make a deposit into their newly opened account, using a dataset from a Portuguese bank's marketing campaign.
- Data Mining Course - Spring 2024


## Dataset Description
The dataset represents a marketing campaign by a Portuguese bank, containing customer information.
The dataset contains 11162 samples, with 16 features. The features include:
- Demographic information: age, job, marital status, education
- Financial information: default, housing, loan
- Marketing campaign information: contact, month, day of week, duration, campaign, pdays, previous, poutcome
- Target variable: deposit (binary categorical)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA notebook provides an exploratory data analysis of the dataset, including:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualization of the data using various plots and charts

## Classification 
The classification notebook develops a machine learning model to classify customers based on their observed features. The model is trained using a variety of algorithms, including KNN and decision trees. The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Clustering 
The clustering notebook applies clustering algorithms to the dataset to identify patterns and group similar customers together. The algorithms used include k-means and hierarchical clustering. The results of the clustering analysis are visualized using various plots and charts.
